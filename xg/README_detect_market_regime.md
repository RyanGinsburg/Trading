📄 README_detect_market_regime.md
=================================

This file outlines how to implement and apply **market regime detection** using a `detect_market_regime()` function in a multi-level trading strategy evaluation pipeline. The goal is to dynamically alter strategy behavior (e.g., method selection) based on whether the market is trending up, down, or sideways.

🧠 Purpose
----------

Use `detect_market_regime` to classify the market condition for each group of trading days into one of the following:

- `"bull"` → Market is trending upward.
- `"bear"` → Market is trending downward.
- `"sideways"` → Market is flat/range-bound.
- (Optional: Add more categories such as `"volatile"` or `"crash"`.)

These regimes will be used to dynamically **alter which strategy methods are tested**.

🔧 Function: `detect_market_regime`
-----------------------------------

Paste this into your strategy file or `enhanced_strategy_methods.py`:

```python
def detect_market_regime(prices: List[float], window: int = 20, threshold: float = 0.02) -> str:
    """
    Detects market regime based on recent price behavior.
    
    Args:
        prices: List of prices (e.g., open or close) in chronological order.
        window: Number of past days to analyze.
        threshold: Percent change threshold to detect trend.

    Returns:
        One of: 'bull', 'bear', 'sideways', or 'unknown'
    """
    if len(prices) < window:
        return "unknown"

    recent = prices[-window:]
    change = (recent[-1] - recent[0]) / recent[0]

    if change > threshold:
        return "bull"
    elif change < -threshold:
        return "bear"
    else:
        return "sideways"
```

🧩 Integration Instructions
----------------------------

Modify `evaluate_all_combinations_group()` to:

✅ 1. Detect the regime per group:
Add this line near the beginning of `evaluate_all_combinations_group()`:

```python
regime = detect_market_regime([d.open for d in group])
print(f"📊 Detected market regime for group {group_index} ({day_symbol}): {regime}")
```

✅ 2. Select dynamic method sets based on regime:
Right after detecting the regime, define which methods should be tested:

```python
if regime == 'bull':
    level1_methods = [self.level1_exponential_average, self.level1_weighted_average]
    level2_methods = [self.level2_momentum, self.level2_combined]
    level4_methods = [self.level4_aggressive]
elif regime == 'bear':
    level1_methods = [self.level1_median_filter, self.level1_simple_average]
    level2_methods = [self.level2_threshold, self.level2_trend_analysis]
    level4_methods = [self.level4_conservative]
else:  # sideways or unknown
    level1_methods = [self.level1_simple_average, self.level1_raw]
    level2_methods = [self.level2_volatility_based]
    level4_methods = [self.level4_adaptive]
```

You can choose to use **only these** methods for faster runtime or **combine them with the base set** for broader testing.

✅ 3. Optional Use

If needed, you can:
- Pass the `regime` to `backtest_strategy_group()` for deeper control (e.g., entry/exit behavior).
- Store the `regime` as part of group metadata for logging or display.
- Compare strategy performance across different regimes later.

📝 Prompt to Use Later
-----------------------

Give this to ChatGPT when you're ready:

> Apply `detect_market_regime(prices: List[float], window=20)` in each group to classify it as `"bull"`, `"bear"`, or `"sideways"`. Then, modify `evaluate_all_combinations_group()` to dynamically select different sets of Level 1, 2, and 4 methods based on the detected regime. For example, use momentum/aggressive methods for bull, conservative/median-based for bear, and adaptive/volatility-based for sideways. Print the regime per group during backtest.
